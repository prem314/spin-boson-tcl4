# How to use the Supplementary material

All the main results of this work are available in `TCL4DynamicsSpinBosonResults.nb`.

## TCL General Derivation

* `TCLIntegrandCalcs.wl` starts from the expressions for the TCL2 and TCL4 generators (see Breuer & Petruccione, 2001) and derives their matrix elements in Bloch-vector form.  
* `TCL2GeneratorCalc.wl` evaluates the general TCL2 generator using those results.  
* `TCL4TripleTimeIntegral.wl` symbolically performs the tripleâ€“time integrals of the TCL4 generator matrix elements, and `TCL4OmegaIntegral.wl` then evaluates the associated frequency integrals in the long-time limit.  
* `DQDTCL4GeneratorEvaluation.wl` reproduces the DQD-dynamics figure and can also be used for any odd spectral density (see the numerical-integral caveat).  
* `O2SSCalcSpinBoson.wl` analytically evaluates the second- and fourth-order steady-state results.

## Verification of our results

* `TCL4DrudeGeneratorCalcV2.wl` and `TCL2DrudeGeneratorCalc.wl` carry out the TCL4 and TCL2 calculations for an Ohmic spectral density with a Drude cutoff.  
* `TCL4Verification.wl` cross-checks the general result against these Drude calculations and reproduces the TCL4-verification figure.  
* `TCL4PrecisionVerification.wl` repeats the check at higher numerical precision for \(F_{31}^{(4)}\) and \(F_{41}^{(4)}\).

## Benchmarking with HEOM

* `TCLVsHEOMFidelity.wl` (Mathematica) computes the TCL results and writes them to `python_objects.txt` in the same folder.  
* `tcl_vs_heom.py` (Python) reads `python_objects.txt`, runs the HEOM calculation with **QuTiP**, and compares the two approaches, reproducing the fidelity-comparison figure.

## Non-Markovianity analysis

* `SpinBosonTraceDistancePlotCode.wl` performs the non-Markovianity calculations and reproduces the trace-distance figure.
